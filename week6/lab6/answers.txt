Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

-> With a small numner of simulation (<1000) the predictions seem quite random if compared
    to the predictions with a higher number of simulations.
   Specially, in a simulation I ran, (N = 10) Spain was estimated a 40% win change compared
    to the actual 11% chance.
   Also, in a simulation I ran, (n = 100) Brazil ended up as the favorated team, while
    the more accurate results always showed Belgium as the favorated.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

-> At ten tousand simulations I would call the predictions good enough, they were in fact
    really close to the more accurate ones and compared to the hundred tousand simulations
    program the time of execution was eight times smaller.
