QUESTION 1:
-> If the 100 songs in the database where the top 100 songs of a person in the year,
    I would assign to this person the aura color PURPLE.
   I chose the PURPLE aura for the person because it chose songs that have a great danceability,
    this is confirmed by the high average of 0.72 in danceability.
   The person also chose relatively energetic songs, with an energy of 0.66 on average.
   While the valence has a great variability suggesting that the person listens to music in different
    mind states, when she's happy and sad regardless.
   Therefore this is a person that wants to dance with the music at any moment of the day, with different moods,
    like people with a PURPLE aura.

QUESTION 2:
-> Calculating the aura in this way does not take count of how much time was spent listening to a specific song,
    pheraps the top 100 songs are not representative of what the person prefered the most.
   If there is a big difference of listening time within the first and the last of the 100 songs, then the
    getting the mean of all of the 100 songs was a blind strategy to determine the person's preferences.
    Because pheraps the first 30 songs' listening time is much grater than the rest of the songs in the list altogether.

   My strategy would be that of taking into account for how long each song was listened to. I would take the mean
    of the three parameters adding weight to each song based on how long it was listened to.
